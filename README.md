# Grade Tracker

#####  IBDP SL Computer Science Mini Project

- **What does the program do?**
The program is designed to process all the test scores inputted for user's each subjects. The analysis will return final grades and detailed graph for each assessments. 

- **What is the development circumstances?**
The ideology of the program and the user's needs are specified by the teacher. However, the inside structure is completely designed by Harry Yu despite some inspirations from the model version teacher provided. There is a version almost completely finished for references, but personally I haven't look at it. 

- **Where is the program currently at?** 
The program currently already has an overall structure to it, but only the background database classes and the initWindow GUI class is structured to details. The program is coded in a top down manner, and overall the program is still at the planning phase. 

- **Currently Under Development - Database**
1. For the database section: make an accessor and relevant simple manipulators(addone() for instanceCount)
2. integrate a csv reading and writing system in there
